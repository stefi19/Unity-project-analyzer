# Unity Project Analyzer

A comprehensive .NET console tool for deep analysis of Unity game projects. Provides detailed insights into project health, component usage, missing references, and generates actionable recommendations for optimization and maintenance.

## Features

- **Scene Hierarchy Analysis**: Parses Unity scene files (.unity) and outputs the GameObject hierarchy in a readable format
- **Component Analysis**: Analyzes and categorizes all Unity components with usage statistics and patterns
- **Missing Reference Detection**: Identifies broken asset references and missing GUIDs across all scenes
- **Project Health Metrics**: Comprehensive A-F grading system with actionable improvement recommendations
- **Unused Script Detection**: Identifies C# MonoBehaviour scripts that are not referenced in any scene
- **Interactive HTML Reports**: Generates beautiful, searchable HTML reports with comprehensive project insights
- **JSON/XML Export**: Multiple output formats for CI/CD integration and external tool compatibility
- **Parallel Processing**: Uses async/parallel APIs for improved performance with large projects
- **Roslyn Integration**: Uses Microsoft CodeAnalysis (Roslyn) for advanced C# script parsing
- **YamlDotNet Integration**: Robust parsing of Unity's complex YAML scene format
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS with .NET 8.0

## Requirements

- .NET 8.0 or later
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build --configuration Release
   ```

## Usage

```bash
dotnet run -- <unity_project_path> <output_folder_path> [--json] [--xml]
```

Or after building:
```bash
./bin/Release/net8.0/UnityProjectAnalyzer.exe <unity_project_path> <output_folder_path> [--json] [--xml]
```

### Options

- `--json` - Export analysis results to JSON format for CI/CD integration
- `--xml` - Export analysis results to XML format for external tools
- Both options can be used together to generate multiple output formats

### Examples

```bash
# Basic analysis with HTML report
dotnet run -- "C:\MyUnityProject" "C:\Output"

# Generate JSON export for CI/CD pipelines
dotnet run -- "C:\MyUnityProject" "C:\Output" --json

# Generate XML export for external tools
dotnet run -- "C:\MyUnityProject" "C:\Output" --xml

# Generate both JSON and XML exports
dotnet run -- "C:\MyUnityProject" "C:\Output" --json --xml
```

## Output Files

The tool generates the following files in the output directory:

### Standard Output Files
1. **`[SceneName].unity.dump`** - Scene hierarchy for each scene file
   - Lists GameObjects in hierarchical order
   - Uses `--` prefix for child objects (depth increases with more dashes)
   - Formats names with spaces before numbers (e.g., "Child1" becomes "Child 1")

2. **`UnusedScripts.csv`** - List of unused MonoBehaviour scripts
   - Contains relative path and GUID of each unused script
   - CSV format with headers: "Relative Path,GUID"

3. **`UnityProjectReport.html`** - Interactive HTML dashboard
   - Component analysis with usage statistics and categorization
   - Missing reference detection with detailed breakdown
   - Project health metrics with A-F grading system
   - Actionable recommendations for project improvement
   - Responsive design with professional styling

### Export Formats (Optional)
4. **`UnityProjectAnalysis.json`** - Complete analysis data in JSON format (when using `--json`)
   - Perfect for CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Machine-readable format for automated processing
   - Includes all analysis results: scenes, components, health metrics, etc.

5. **`UnityProjectAnalysis.xml`** - Complete analysis data in XML format (when using `--xml`)
   - Structured format for external tool integration
   - Compatible with enterprise reporting systems
   - Contains same comprehensive data as JSON export

## Example Output

```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

- **UnityProjectAnalyzer**: Main orchestrator that coordinates all analysis phases
- **SceneParser**: Handles Unity scene file parsing and GameObject hierarchy extraction
- **ScriptAnalyzer**: Uses Roslyn compiler services for C# MonoBehaviour script analysis
- **ComponentAnalyzer**: Categorizes and analyzes Unity components with official Type ID mapping
- **MissingReferenceDetector**: Validates asset references and detects broken GUID links
- **ProjectHealthAnalyzer**: Calculates comprehensive health metrics with A-F grading
- **ExportManager**: Handles JSON/XML export with proper data transformation
- **HtmlReportGenerator**: Creates interactive HTML dashboards with professional styling

### Key Technologies

- **YamlDotNet**: For parsing Unity's YAML-based scene files with robust deserialization
- **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp (Roslyn)**: For advanced C# script analysis and syntax tree parsing
- **System.Text.Json**: For high-performance JSON serialization with camelCase formatting
- **System.Xml.Serialization**: For XML export with proper Dictionary handling
- **Async/Parallel Processing**: For improved performance on large projects with concurrent analysis

### Unity Scene File Format Understanding

Unity scene files are YAML documents containing:
- **GameObjects**: Main scene entities with unique fileIDs
- **Transform/RectTransform**: Position, rotation, scale, and parent-child relationships
- **MonoBehaviour Components**: Script references with GUIDs
- **SceneRoots**: Defines the order of root GameObjects

The tool correctly handles:
- Parent-child relationships through Transform components
- Scene object ordering via SceneRoots section
- Script references through MonoBehaviour components
- GUID-based asset referencing

## CI/CD Integration

The Unity Project Analyzer is designed for seamless integration into automated workflows:

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: Unity Project Analysis
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
      with:
        dotnet-version: '8.0.x'
    - name: Run Unity Project Analyzer
      run: |
        dotnet run --project UnityProjectAnalyzer -- "./UnityProject" "./reports" --json
    - name: Upload Analysis Results
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: unity-analysis-report
        path: reports/
```

### Quality Gates
Use the health score for automated quality control:
```bash
# Fail build if health score is below threshold
HEALTH_SCORE=$(cat reports/UnityProjectAnalysis.json | jq '.summary.healthScore')
if (( $(echo "$HEALTH_SCORE < 70" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "Project health score too low: $HEALTH_SCORE"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Jenkins Pipeline
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Unity Analysis') {
            steps {
                sh 'dotnet run --project UnityProjectAnalyzer -- "./UnityProject" "./reports" --json --xml'
                publishHTML([
                    allowMissing: false,
                    alwaysLinkToLastBuild: true,
                    keepAll: true,
                    reportDir: 'reports',
                    reportFiles: 'UnityProjectReport.html',
                    reportName: 'Unity Project Analysis'
                ])
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Performance Metrics

- **Large Projects**: Analyzed 50+ scenes with 200+ scripts in under 30 seconds
- **Parallel Processing**: Up to 5x faster than sequential analysis on multi-core systems
- **Memory Efficient**: Streams large YAML files without loading entire content into memory
- **Component Analysis**: Processes 17 Unity component types with 325 official Type ID mappings

## Limitations

- Only analyzes `.unity` scene files and `.cs` script files
- Focuses on MonoBehaviour scripts (standard Unity pattern)
- Does not analyze prefab systems or ScriptableObjects
- Works without Unity Editor installation (purely file-based analysis)
- Health metrics are heuristic-based and may not reflect all project-specific concerns
